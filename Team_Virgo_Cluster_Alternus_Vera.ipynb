In other words, the more news sources (outside the article) talk about the same event, the more credible the article is as a whole. Some fake news are designed to confuse audiences and make them lose trust in reliable news (Shu et al, 2017). \n",

When we read an article about a topic we think is \"too good to be true\", we cross-check with other news websites under Google News or Twitter to read up on the event or topic. This is backed by the idea that there are fake users and bot account purposely desigend to spread false stories (Shu et al., 2017).  **Through tips and advice on slack, just because there are ample number of coverage on some topic, it does not necessarily mean that the particular article in question is a reliable (non-fake news).** (Arsanjani, 2018). This factor should be used in conjunction with other factors such as \"bias\", \"sensationalism\", and \"social media activites\" to further reduce the impurity of the classifications. We can treat this factor as an intermediary step to be factored early in the process to remove True Positives.\n"

        "**Building a Model** This \"search\" part should only be done during training stage, but not during testing and validation stages.

Also, if the model simply looks up in internal database and return the score, it is more or less a search solution, not a Machine Learning Classification solution.\n",

Sometimes the keywords generated by LDA such as \"Car\", \"Bus\", \"Train\" all have the latent super-topic called \"transporation\".  So in our distillation not only we should filter out stop words and run lemmatization, we should condense the words even further such as \"transportation\".
